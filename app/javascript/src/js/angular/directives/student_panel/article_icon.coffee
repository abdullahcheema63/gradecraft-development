# Each icon is turned on by by a boolean on the assignment or badge model with the same name.
# Icons are defined in the predictor service and looped through in the haml:
# "is_required", "is_late", "has_info", "is_locked", "has_been_unlocked", "is_a_condition", "group"
# example:
#   .predictor-article-icon{'ng-repeat'=>'icon in icons',
#     'icon-name'=>'icon', 'article'=>'assignment', 'article_type'=>'assignment'}
#
# This Does not handle locked/unlocked icons, which include lists conditions
# and is managed by /templates/student_panel/panel_article/condition_icons.html.haml
