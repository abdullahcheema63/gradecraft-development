# Creates a checkbox that manages a boolean state on an Assignment. Note that
# the state of the attribute is passed directly to the scope, rather than querried
# off the Assignment in the service.  This simplifies state management,
# and allows the service to continue to operate in the Predictor with boolean
# states that don't map to the model.
#
# For example:
#   in ruby: assignment.accepts_submissions
#   in the service: assignment.is_accepting_submissions
# The booleans passed in the json take into account the current user, due dates
# and closing dates, and calculate state management before being picked up by Angular.
#
# We could update this if we find a need to have the assigments in the service
# remain in sync with updates performed on the settings page.
# We would have to map all boolean attributes back to those on the server, and
# also update the predictor service to handle state logic.
