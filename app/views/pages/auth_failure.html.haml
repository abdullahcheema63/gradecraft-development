    %p Are you sure you have a GradeCraft account? Some students <b>must</b> log in through their Learning Management System (Canvas, Blackboard, Moodle, etc) before they can access GradeCraft directly. You may also want to verify what email address you should be using to log in with your instructor. Still having problems? Contact us.
