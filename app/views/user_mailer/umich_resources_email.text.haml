Welcome to GradeCraft!

Hello, #{@user.first_name}

Thank you for adding GradeCraft to your course! GradeCraft is a tool built at the University of Michigan that facilitates teaching from a gameful perspective. Here are some highlights of how we do things differently:

* Students' grades start from zero and build up
* Students can predict and track their grades
* Create assessment paths for students or allow them to create their own
* Integrates with Canvas to import grades from quizzes or used as a
standalone gradebook

As you begin to explore and build your course, here are some resources that may help:
