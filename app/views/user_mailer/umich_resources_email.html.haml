  %strong Hello, #{@user.first_name}

%h3 Welcome to GradeCraft!

%p Thank you for adding GradeCraft to your course!  GradeCraft is a tool built at the University of Michigan that facilitates teaching from a gameful perspective.  Some highlights of how we do things differently:

%ul
  %li Studentsâ€™ grades start from zero and build up
  %li Students can predict and track their grades
  %li Create assessment paths for students or allow them to create their own
  %li Integrates with Canvas to import grades from quizzes or used as a standalone gradebook.

%p As you begin to explore and build your course, we wanted to share some resources to help:
