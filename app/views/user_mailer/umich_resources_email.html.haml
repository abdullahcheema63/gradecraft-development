    Welcome to GradeCraft!

  %p
    Hello, #{@user.first_name}

  %p
    Thank you for adding GradeCraft to your course! GradeCraft is a tool built at the University of Michigan that facilitates teaching from a gameful perspective. Here are some highlights of how we do things differently:

  %ul
    %li Studentsâ€™ grades start from zero and build up
    %li Students can predict and track their grades
    %li Create assessment paths for students or allow them to create their own
    %li Integrates with Canvas to import grades from quizzes or used as a standalone gradebook
