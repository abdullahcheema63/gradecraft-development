module EventLogger
  # This class is intended to be inherited by EventLogger subclasses that
  # interact directly with Resque in anyway. It implements multiple behaviors
  # such as advanced logging, retry, and interaction with the target
  # Analytics class that make it much easier to use this class as a base rather
  # than a naked class from which #perform is being called
  #
  # Almost all of the behavior here is intended for the use of this class as a
  # class constant to be passed into Resque and not as an object. If you'd like
  # more advanced enqueuing behaviors consider including EventLogger::Enqueue
  # or EventLogger::Params in your EventLogger::Base subclass
  #
