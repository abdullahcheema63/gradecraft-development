# this module is the initial declaration and entry point for the EventLogger
# library. It should be used for all system Resque jobs that directly interact
# with the Analytics library or log events. If you need to create a background
# job that doesn't interact with analytics or events it's probably best to use
# the ResqueJob library as it's behaviors are agnostic to how it's being used,
# whereas the EventLogger jobs presume interaction with event Analytics and
# logging to the Mongo backend
